# Audio Encryption and Verification using Digital Signature

The project aims to make the exchange of critical information more secure by making it discrete.  

The message is hidden (embedded) in an audio file. This process is known as STEGANOGRAPHY, to be specific - AUDIO STEGANOGRAPHY. 

Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination. The use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data. 

Audio steganography is about hiding the secret message in the audio. It is a technique used to secure the transmission of secret information or hide their existence. It provides confidentiality (makes it discrete) to the said message is encrypted.  

●	The steganography algorithm used here introduces a negligible amount of noise to the audio which is typically undetectable by humans.  

●	This modified audio file is the encrypted and sent to the user via suitable medium/media.
